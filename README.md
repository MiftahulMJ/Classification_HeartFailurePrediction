# Classification_HeartFailurePrediction

## Project Portfolio Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors

I took the dataset from kaggle with the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction 
This data collection was carried out with the aim of classifying patients with heart failure.

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm used to classify new data based on existing data. This algorithm uses the concept that similar data will be close to each other.

This classification process includes data preprocessing, model creation with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, and evaluation of the results using the conclusion matrix. The results obtained from this process are very good with an accuracy of 86%
